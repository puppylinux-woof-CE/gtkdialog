Compilation and Installation
============================

Initially you'll need to run ./autogen.sh in place of ./configure to
generate the build scripts but after that it's the usual:

	./configure
	make
	make install

The doc/reference/* and examples/* don't install by default so you might
like to copy them somewhere.

Support for using Glade generated user interfaces is very old and I'd
rather not encourage folk to create Gtkdialog applications in this way.

VTE
---
Gtkdialog's configure script will compile-in support for the Virtual
Terminal Emulator if it finds libvte and its development headers.
libvte source package -> http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/vte/

ARM
---
A problem was encountered when compiling on the ARM platform whereby the
widgets were being packed in the wrong order and I have applied a fix for
this wrapped in an #ifdef __arm__ preprocessor macro in automaton.c:1827.
